## Error messages

### Installation

#### Docker

🙋‍♂️I can’t connect to Postgres DB inside another docker container. I'm trying to install Forest Admin using docker but my database is running inside a different container and I'm using a custom port. I can access it without any problems via `psql` but then I get an error.

🙋‍♂️ When I try to deploy lumber-admin via Docker with a remote database, I am getting an error `Error: Unprocessable Entity`

I suspect a problem on DB, but I cannot find any details or logs about this event. So, my main question is: where I can find any logs?

🙋🏾 I was able to link my data to Forest admin (with docker, on port 5433).

#### Ruby on Rails

🙋🏻‍♀️ I created a new project using Ruby on Rails as the datasource. I followed instructions, added gem, migrated, `dev:cache`, and started the server. Everything went smoothly, but once on the admin panel, I am getting the following message:

_Unable to authenticate you_

_Please verify that your admin backend is correctly configured and running._
