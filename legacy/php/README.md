# PHP Agent Documentation (End of Life)

> **Status:** END OF LIFE
>
> **Audience:** Legacy PHP users

## End of Life Notice

**The Forest Admin PHP agent has reached End of Life and is no longer supported.**

- ❌ No security updates
- ❌ No bug fixes
- ❌ No new features
- ❌ No technical support

## Recommended Alternatives

We recommend transitioning to one of our actively supported agents:

1. **Node.js Agent** (Recommended)
   - [Get Started with Node.js](/reference/agent-api/nodejs)
   - Modern, actively maintained
   - Full feature support
   - TypeScript support

2. **Ruby Agent**
   - [Get Started with Ruby](/reference/agent-api/ruby)
   - Active development
   - Rails integration

## Migration Options

### Option 1: Migrate to Node.js (Recommended)

If you have a mixed stack or can add a Node.js service:
- Deploy Node.js agent as standalone service
- Connect to your existing database
- No changes to your PHP application needed

### Option 2: Maintain PHP Application, Use Node.js for Admin

- Keep your PHP application as-is
- Deploy separate Node.js service for Forest Admin
- Both connect to same database
- Forest Admin traffic goes through Node.js agent

### Option 3: Fully Migrate to Supported Platform

Consider migrating your entire admin/backoffice to a supported stack.
